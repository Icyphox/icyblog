# Setup
## My daily drivers — hardware and software

### Hardware

The only computer I have with me is my [HP Envy 13 (2018)](https://store.hp.com/us/en/mdp/laptops/envy-13) (my model looks a little different). It’s a 13” ultrabook, with an i5 8250u,
8 gigs of RAM and a 256 GB NVMe SSD. It’s a very comfy machine that does everything I need it to.

For my phone, I use a [OnePlus 6T](https://www.oneplus.in/6t), running stock [OxygenOS](https://www.oneplus.in/oxygenos). As of this writing, its bootloader hasn’t been unlocked and nor has the device been rooted.
I’m also a proud owner of a [Nexus 5], which I really wish Google rebooted. It’s surprisingly still usable and runs Android Pie, although the SIM slot is busted, and the battery life is abysmal.

My keyboard, although not with me in college, is a very old [Dell SK-8110](https://www.amazon.com/Dell-Keyboard-Model-SK-8110-Interface/dp/B00366HMMO). 
For the little bit of gaming that I do, I use a [HP m150] gaming mouse. It’s the perfect size (and color).
