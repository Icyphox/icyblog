# обо мне
## Hi.

I'm Anirudh, and I go by **icyphox** on the Internet. I'm doing my
undergrad right now, majoring in Computer Science. My primary interest
is security---information, operational and national. Tradecraft,
espionage and military tactics interest me deeply, and I love discussing
them.

I care about software freedom and digital privacy, and I am a staunch
advocate of the same. I try to use free alternatives to software, if
they exist.

I write code at times, begrudgingly. Take a look at my projects on
[GitHub](https://github.com/icyphox).

My taste in music is very specific, and I hardly ever experiment. I like
to stick to subgenres of metal, specifically---metalcore and deathcore.

Here are some of my links:
