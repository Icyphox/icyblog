# обо мне
## Hi.

I'm Anirudh, but you'll often find me as **icyphox** (or just **icy**),
on the Internet. I'm majoring in Computer Science currently. My primary
interest is security -- with a focus on influence operations,
information warfare and state-sponsored actors. I write code on the
occasion, most of which you can find on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/icyphox).

I care about software freedom and digital privacy, and I am a staunch
advocate of the same. I try to use free alternatives to software, if
they exist.

My taste in music is very specific, and I hardly ever experiment. I like
to stick to subgenres of metal, specifically -- metalcore and deathcore.

Here are some of my links:

- [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/u/icy)
- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Icyphox)
- [Reddit](https://reddit.com/u/icyphox)
- [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/icyphox)
- [Last.fm](https://last.fm/user/icyphox)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/icyphox)

Note that my Twitter is now read-only. I'm more active on the fediverse:

## Donate

but it does help with domain and server costs. :)
