I'm Anirudh Oppiliappan, often found as **icyphox** (or sometimes just
**icy**) on the Internet. I currently live in beautiful Helsinki,
Finland and work for [UpCloud](https://upcloud.com) as a Kubernetes
Engineer. Below are a few things that interest me, and can serve as
conversation starters for you:

- Infrastructure and distributed systems.
- Motorsport. I closely follow F1, F2 and F3.
- Startups and indie-hacking. Admittedly, I don't know much but I follow
  the space.
- Fitness. Strength training, calisthenics.
- The Go programming language. I love Go and I swear by the standard
  library.
- (Spoken) language learning. Currently learning Finnish. Big
  fan of total immersion and comprehensible input.
- Self-hosting and homelabbing.
- Ergonomic keyboards. I like to build them. I also like to use them.
- Electric skateboarding and PEVs.
- 35mm film photography.
- Veganism, ethics and plant-based nutrition.
- Effective altruism, albeit mostly focused on animal welfare for now. I
  donate to:
  * [Good Food Institute](https://gfi.org)
  * [ACE Recommended
  Charities](https://animalcharityevaluators.org/recommended-charities/)


I maintain a somewhat active list of tech that I [use](/uses).
