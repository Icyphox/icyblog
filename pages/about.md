# Hi.

I'm Anirudh, but you'll often find me as **icyphox** (or just **icy**),
on the Internet. I currently work as a Site Reliability Engineer at
[DeepSource](https://deepsource.io).

Here's a list of things that I'm interested in, or care deeply about
(also serve as good conversation starters if you want to talk to me!):

- security
    - low level stuff (think: binary/kernel exploitation)
    - threat research
    - physical vectors
    - disinformation
    - state-sponsored actors
- privacy
    - secure communications
    - operational security
    - anti-surveillance
- free software
- infrastructure
    - monitoring and observability
    - distributed systems
- heavy music
    - metalcore
    - deathcore
- strategy games (I'm not very good at them)
    - Runeterra
    - Dota 2
