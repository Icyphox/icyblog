# Hi, I’m Anirudh.

I go by [icyphox](https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=icyphox) on the Internet. I’m doing my undergrad right now, majoring in CS. My primary interest is computer security, and more specifically — **offensive security** and **digital forensics**. I’m also a CTF player/security researcher at [Sector443](https://sector443.xyz), an infosec community at my University. My [blog](/blog) has a few write-ups that you might want to check out.

In my free time (which I tend to have a lot of) I contribute to open-source projects like the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) programming language. Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/icyphox) profile for more of my work.

Atmospheric/electronic metal subgenres are my jam. If it djents, I like it. My [Last.fm](https://last.fm/user/Icyphox) should be self-explanatory. For those who didn’t click it: bands like _Oceans Ate Alaska_, _I See Stars_, _Invent Animate_, _Make Them Suffer_, _Ice Nine Kills_, etc.

Want to **hire me**? I’m down for freelance security work. Here’s my [résumé](https://x.icyphox.sh/resume.pdf).
