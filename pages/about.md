I'm Anirudh Oppiliappan, often found as **icyphox** (or sometimes just
**icy**) on the Internet. I live in Bangalore, India and work for
[Ory](https://ory.sh) as a Site Reliability Engineer. Below are a few
things that interest me, and can serve as conversation starters for you:
- security -- in and around cloud-native tech/containers, opsec, threat intel
- infrastructure
- geopolitics and natsec -- specifically Russia and eastern Europe
- motorsport -- Formula 1/2/3/E
- startups
- fitness
- OpenBSD
- the Go programming language
