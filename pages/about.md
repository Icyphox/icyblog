I'm Anirudh, but you'll find me as **icyphox** (or just **icy**), on the
Internet. I currently work as a Site Reliability Engineer at
[DeepSource](https://deepsource.io).

## contact

Send mail to [x@icyphox.sh](mailto:x@icyphox.sh). Should you need it, my
[PGP key](/static/gpg.txt):

```
FE1B 8FCF E6C1 6222 F157 1C8E 8A93 F96F 78C5 D4C4
```

I generally always reply within the day. Alternative means of
communication, like my phone number, are only given out on a
need-to-know basis.

Some of my links:

- [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/u/icy)
- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=icy)
- [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/icyphox)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/icyphox)

The only social media I actively use is the fediverse:

If you're interested in **hiring me** -- here's my
[résumé](https://x.icyphox.sh/resume.pdf).

## this site

This site is built using [vite](https://git.icyphox.sh/vite) -- a static
site generator written in Go. The wiki index is generated using a [shell
script](https://git.icyphox.sh/site/tree/bin/wiki.sh), with heavy use of
bashisms. This script runs prior to vite, and preps the wiki index
page's markdown.

Nearly all media content, barring some old images, are served from my
file host at https://x.icyphox.sh. This is hosted on my Raspberry Pi, at
home. If you notice slow image loads, this is why. At present, I have no
plans to change this setup.
