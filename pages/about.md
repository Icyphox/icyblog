If you're interested in **hiring me** -- here's my
[résumé](https://x.icyphox.sh/resume.pdf).

## this site

This site is built using [vite](https://git.icyphox.sh/vite) -- a static
site generator written in Go.

Nearly all media content, barring some old images, are served from my
file host at https://x.icyphox.sh. This is hosted on my Raspberry Pi, at
home. If you notice slow image loads, this is why. At present, I have no
plans to change this setup.
