## Hi, I'm Anirudh.

But you'll see me as [icyphox](https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=icyphox) on the Internet. 
I’m doing my undergrad right now, majoring in CS. My primary interest is computer security, and more specifically — **offensive security** and **digital forensics**. 
On the less technical side of things, I love discussing **operational security** and **tradecraft**.
I’m also a CTF player/security researcher at [Sector443](https://sector443.xyz), an infosec community at my University. 
Sometimes, I will compose a post for my [blog](/blog).

In my free time (which I tend to have a lot of) I contribute to open-source projects like the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) programming language.
Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/icyphox) profile for more of my work. 

Atmospheric/electronic metal subgenres are my jam. If it djents, I like it. My [Last.fm](https://last.fm/user/Icyphox) should be self-explanatory.
For those who didn’t click it: bands like _Oceans Ate Alaska_, _I See Stars_, _Invent Animate_, _Make Them Suffer_, _Ice Nine Kills_, etc.

You might be interested in my setup, which I’ve written about in detail [here](/blog/my-setup).

I love languages, but I can never stick to one. I currently speak English, French, Tamil
and Hindi. I can understand and read _very_ basic Japanese, and I've just begun learning
Russian which I'm really enjoying so far.

Apart from the links above, you can also find me on

## This website

The site itself is built using my own static site generator — [vite](https://github.com/icyphox/vite). 

This site uses no cookies, and I'm generally not interested in any form of tracking/analytics. However, my DNS and SSL provider, CloudFlare,
does collect basic data like site hits and demographics. I've been meaning to get rid of it, but laziness has gotten the best of me.
