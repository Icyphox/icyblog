# Hi.

I'm Anirudh, but you'll often find me as **icyphox** (or just **icy**),
on the Internet. I'm majoring in Computer Science. My primary interest
is security -- with a focus on influence operations, information warfare
and state-sponsored actors. I also dabble in infrastructure. I
currently work for [DeepSource](https://deepsource.io).

I care about software freedom, privacy and freedom of speech -- yes I'm
a free speech absolutist. I have other varied interests, but to sum them
up: I listen to heavy music (metalcore/deathcore), read high fantasy,
and play card games.

Here are some of my links:

- [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/u/icy)
- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=icy)
- [Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/icyphox)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/icyphox)
- [git.icyphox.sh](https://git.icyphox.sh)
- [Last.fm](https://last.fm/user/icyphox)

The only social media I actively use is the fediverse:
