# Hi, I’m Anirudh.

But you'll see me as [icyphox](https://www.startpage.com/do/search?query=icyphox) on the Internet. 
I’m doing my undergrad right now, majoring in CS. My primary interest is computer security, and more specifically — **offensive security** and **digital forensics**. 
I’m also a CTF player/security researcher at [Sector443](https://sector443.xyz), an infosec community at my University. 
My [blog](/blog) has a few write-ups that you might want to check out.

In my free time (which I tend to have a lot of) I contribute to open-source projects like the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) programming language.
Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/icyphox) profile for more of my work. 

Atmospheric/electronic metal subgenres are my jam. If it djents, I like it. My [Last.fm](https://last.fm/user/Icyphox) should be self-explanatory.
For those who didn’t click it: bands like _Oceans Ate Alaska_, _I See Stars_, _Invent Animate_, _Make Them Suffer_, _Ice Nine Kills_, etc.

You might be interested in my setup, which I’ve written about in detail [here](/blog/my-setup). But here's the gist of it.

- laptop: HP Envy 13, i5 8250u, 8GB/256GB
- distro: Debian 9 Stretch
- window manager: i3

## This website

The site itself is built using my own static site generator — [vite](https://github.com/icyphox/vite). 

This site uses no cookies, and I'm generally not interested in any form of tracking/analytics. However, my DNS and SSL provider, CloudFlare,
does collect basic data like site hits and demographics. I've been meaning to get rid of it, but laziness has gotten the best of me.
