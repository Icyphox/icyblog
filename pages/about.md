# About
I'm Anirudh, but I generally go by [icyphox](https://www.google.com/search?q=icyphox) on the Internet. This is all about me.

## Interests
I have a *lot* of interests, but I primarily focus on these:

- information security 
- digital forensics
- social engineering and physical security
- free and open source software

I have long since been doing red-team activity in security, but I'm branching out and exploring blue-team work too.  
I'm currently studying **reverse engineering** and **malware analysis**, Windows OS internals, and cyber forensics.

## Music
I'm super picky when it comes to my music. I specifically listen to atmospheric/electronic/melodic **metalcore** and **deathcore**.  
Some of the bands I like:

- I See Stars
- Oceans Ate Alaska
- Make Them Suffer
- Invent Animate
