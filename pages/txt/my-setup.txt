My setup

My daily drivers---hardware, software and workflow

Hardware

   The only computer I have with me is my [1]HP Envy 13 (2018) (my model
   looks a little different). It's a 13" ultrabook, with an i5 8250u, 8
   gigs of RAM and a 256 GB NVMe SSD. It's a very comfy machine that does
   everything I need it to.

   For my phone, I use a [2]OnePlus 6T, running stock [3]OxygenOS. As of
   this writing, its bootloader hasn't been unlocked and nor has the
   device been rooted. I'm also a proud owner of a [4]Nexus 5, which I
   really wish Google rebooted. It's surprisingly still usable and runs
   Android Pie, although the SIM slot is ruined and the battery backup is
   abysmal.

   My watch is a [5]Samsung Gear S3 Frontier. Tizen is definitely better
   than Android Wear.

   My keyboard, although not with me in college, is a very old [6]Dell
   SK-8110. For the little bit of gaming that I do, I use a [7]HP m150
   gaming mouse. It's the perfect size (and color).

   For my music, I use the [8]Bose SoundLink II. Great pair of headphones,
   although the ear cups need replacing.

And the software

   [DEL: My distro of choice for the past ~1 year has been [9]elementary
   OS. I used to be an Arch Linux elitist, complete with an esoteric
   window manager, all riced. I now use whatever JustWorks(TM). :DEL]

   Update: As of June 2019, I've switched over to a vanilla Debian 9
   Stretch install, running [10]i3 as my window manager. If you want, you
   can dig through my configs at my [11]dotfiles repo.

   Here's a (riced) screenshot of my desktop.

   scrot

   Most of my work is done in either the browser, or the terminal. My
   shell is pure [12]zsh, as in no plugin frameworks. It's customized
   using built-in zsh functions. Yes, you don't actually need a framework.
   It's useless bloat. The prompt itself is generated using a framework I
   built in [13]Nim -- [14]nicy. My primary text editor is [15]nvim.
   Again, all configs in my dotfiles repo linked above. I manage all my
   passwords using [16]pass(1), and I use [17]rofi-pass to access them via
   rofi.

   Most of my security tooling is typically run via a Kali Linux docker
   container. This is convenient for many reasons, keeps your global
   namespace clean and a single command to drop into a Kali shell.

   I use a DigitalOcean droplet (BLR1) as a public filehost, found at
   [18]x.icyphox.sh. The UI is the wonderful [19]serve, by [20]ZEIT. The
   same box also serves as my IRC bouncer and OpenVPN (TCP), which I
   tunnel via SSH running on 443. Campus firewall woes.

   I plan on converting my desktop back at home into a homeserver setup.
   Soon(TM).
