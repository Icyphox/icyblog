Weekly status update, 09/17-09/27

Alpine Linux shenaningans and more

   It's a lazy Friday afternoon here; yet another off day this week thanks
   to my uni's fest. My last "weekly" update was 10 days ago, and a lot
   has happened since then. Let's get right into it!

My switch to Alpine

   Previously, I ran Debian with Buster/Sid repos, and ever since this
   happened
$ dpkg --list | wc -l
3817

# or something in that ballpark

   I've been wanting to reduce my system's package count.

   Thus, I began my search for a smaller, simpler and lighter distro with
   a fairly sane package manager. I did come across Dylan Araps' [1]KISS
   Linux project, but it seemed a little too hands-on for me (and still
   relatively new). I finally settled on [2]Alpine Linux. According to
   their website:

     Alpine Linux is a security-oriented, lightweight Linux distribution
     based on musl libc and busybox.

   The installation was a breeze, and I was quite surprised to see WiFi
   working OOTB. In the past week of my using this distro, the only major
   hassle I faced was getting my Minecraft launcher to run. The JRE isn't
   fully ported to musl yet.^[3]1 The solution to that is fairly trivial
   and I plan to write about it soon. (hint: it involves chroots)

Packaging for Alpine

   On a related note, I've been busy packaging some of the stuff I use for
   Alpine -- you can see my personal [4]aports repository if you're
   interested. I'm currently working on packaging Nim too, so keep an eye
   out for that in the coming week.

Talk selection at PyCon India!

   Yes! My buddy Raghav ([5]@_vologue) and I are going to be speaking at
   PyCon India about our recent smart lock security research. The
   conference is happening in Chennai, much to our convenience. If you're
   attending too, hit me up on Twitter and we can hang!

Other

   That essentially sums up the technical stuff that I did. My Russian is
   going strong, my reading however, hasn't. I have yet to finish those
   books! This week, for sure.

   Musically, I've been experimenting. I tried a bit of hip-hop and
   chilltrap, and I think I like it? I still find myself coming back to
   metalcore/deathcore. Here's a list of artists I discovered (and liked)
   recently:
     * [6]Before I Turn
     * Conform » (couldn't find any official YouTube video, check Spotify)
     * [7]Treehouse Burning
     * [8]Lee McKinney
     * [9]Berried Alive (rediscovered)

   That's it for now, I'll see you next week!
