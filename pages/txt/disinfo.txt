Disinformation demystified

Misinformation, but deliberate

   As with the disambiguation of any word, let's start with its etymology
   and definiton. According to [1]Wikipedia, disinformation has been
   borrowed from the Russian word -- dezinformatisya (dezinforma'ciya),
   derived from the title of a KGB black propaganda department.

     Disinformation is false information spread deliberately to deceive.

   To fully understand disinformation, especially in the modern age, we
   need to understand the key factors of any successful disinformation
   operation:
     * creating disinformation (what)
     * the motivation behind the op, or its end goal (why)
     * the medium used to disperse the falsified information (how)
     * the actor (who)

   At the end, we'll also look at how you can use disinformation
   techniques to maintain OPSEC.

   In order to break monotony, I will also be using the terms "information
   operation", or the shortened forms -- "info op" & "disinfo".

Creating disinformation

   Crafting or creating disinformation is by no means a trivial task.
   Often, the quality of any disinformation sample is a huge indicator of
   the level of sophistication of the actor involved, i.e. is it a 12 year
   old troll or a nation state?

   Well crafted disinformation always has one primary characteristic --
   "plausibility". The disinfo must sound reasonable. It must induce the
   notion it's likely true. To achieve this, the target -- be it an
   individual, a specific demographic or an entire nation -- must be well
   researched. A deep understanding of the target's culture, history,
   geography and psychology is required. It also needs circumstantial and
   situational awareness, of the target.

   There are many forms of disinformation. A few common ones are staged
   videos / photographs, recontextualized videos / photographs, blog
   posts, news articles & most recently -- deepfakes.

   Here's a tweet from [2]the grugq, showing a case of recontextualized
   imagery:

     Disinformation.
     The content of the photo is not fake. The reality of what it
     captured is fake. The context it's placed in is fake. The picture
     itself is 100% authentic. Everything, except the photo itself, is
     fake.
     Recontextualisation as threat vector. [3]pic.twitter.com/Pko3f0xkXC

Motivations behind an information operation

   I like to broadly categorize any info op as either proactive or
   reactive. Proactively, disinformation is spread with the desire to
   influence the target either before or during the occurence of an event.
   This is especially observed during elections.^[5]1 In offensive
   information operations, the target's psychological state can be
   affected by spreading fear, uncertainty & doubt, or FUD for short.

   Reactive disinformation is when the actor, usually a nation state in
   this case, screws up and wants to cover their tracks. A fitting example
   of this is the case of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17), which was
   shot down while flying over eastern Ukraine. This tragic incident has
   been attributed to Russian-backed separatists.^[6]2 Russian media is
   known to have desseminated a number of alternative & some even
   conspiratorial theories^[7]3, in response. The number grew as the JIT's
   (Dutch-lead Joint Investigation Team) investigations pointed towards
   the separatists. The idea was to muddle the information space with
   these theories, and as a result, potentially correct information takes
   a credibility hit.

   Another motive for an info op is to control the narrative. This is
   often seen in use in totalitarian regimes; when the government decides
   what the media portrays to the masses. The ongoing Hong Kong protests
   is a good example.^[8]4 According to [9]NPR:

     Official state media pin the blame for protests on the "black hand"
     of foreign interference, namely from the United States, and what
     they have called criminal Hong Kong thugs. A popular conspiracy
     theory posits the CIA incited and funded the Hong Kong protesters,
     who are demanding an end to an extradition bill with China and the
     ability to elect their own leader. Fueling this theory, China Daily,
     a state newspaper geared toward a younger, more cosmopolitan
     audience, this week linked to a video purportedly showing Hong Kong
     protesters using American-made grenade launchers to combat police.
     ...

Media used to disperse disinfo

   As seen in the above example of totalitarian governments, national TV
   and newspaper agencies play a key role in influence ops en masse. It
   guarantees outreach due to the channel/paper's popularity.

   Twitter is another, obvious example. Due to the ease of creating
   accounts and the ability to generate activity programmatically via the
   API, Twitter bots are the go-to choice today for info ops. Essentially,
   an actor attempts to create "discussions" amongst "users" (read: bots),
   to push their narrative(s). Twitter also provides analytics for every
   tweet, enabling actors to get realtime insights into what sticks and
   what doesn't. The use of Twitter was seen during the previously
   discussed MH17 case, where Russia employed its troll factory -- the
   [10]Internet Research Agency (IRA) to create discussions about
   alternative theories.

   In India, disinformation is often spread via YouTube, WhatsApp and
   Facebook. Political parties actively invest in creating group chats to
   spread political messages and memes. These parties have volunteers
   whose sole job is to sit and forward messages. Apart from political
   propaganda, WhatsApp finds itself as a medium of fake news. In most
   cases, this is disinformation without a motive, or the motive is hard
   to determine simply because the source is impossible to trace, lost in
   forwards.^[11]5 This is a difficult problem to combat, especially given
   the nature of the target audience.

The actors behind disinfo campaigns

   I doubt this requires further elaboration, but in short:
     * nation states and their intelligence agencies
     * governments, political parties
     * other non/quasi-governmental groups
     * trolls

   This essentially sums up the what, why, how and who of disinformation.

Personal OPSEC

   This is a fun one. Now, it's common knowledge that STFU is the best
   policy. But sometimes, this might not be possible, because afterall
   inactivity leads to suspicion, and suspicion leads to scrutiny. Which
   might lead to your OPSEC being compromised. So if you really have to,
   you can feign activity using disinformation. For example, pick a place,
   and throw in subtle details pertaining to the weather, local events or
   regional politics of that place into your disinfo. Assuming this is
   Twitter, you can tweet stuff like:
     * "Ugh, when will this hot streak end?!"
     * "Traffic wonky because of the Mardi Gras parade."
     * "Woah, XYZ place is nice! Especially the fountains by ABC street."

   Of course, if you're a nobody on Twitter (like me), this is a non-issue
   for you.

   And please, don't do this:

Conclusion

   The ability to influence someone's decisions/thought process in just
   one tweet is scary. There is no simple way to combat disinformation.
   Social media is hard to control. Just like anything else in cyber, this
   too is an endless battle between social media corps and motivated
   actors.

   A huge shoutout to Bellingcat for their extensive research in this
   field, and for helping folks see the truth in a post-truth world.
