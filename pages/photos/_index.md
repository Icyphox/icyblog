I picked up 35mm film photography in 2023 and that's all I shoot now. I
currently use a [Canon EOS
55](https://h.icyphox.sh/u/icy/h/4Vh6Y75w1rWC17JRg3) and an Olympus
OM-10. Here are some of my favorite photos from my various travels, with
the most recent trip first. Atom feed available
[here](/photos/feed.xml).
