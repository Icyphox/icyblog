subtitle: Hardware and software that I use.

I often get asked about my computing setup -- so I created this page to link it
whenever. Also because I've seen it on other sites, and I don't want to miss
out.

## hardware

- **Asus ROG Flow X13 (2021)**: 13.4" 4K, Ryzen 9 5900HS, 32GB RAM, 1TB
SSD, Nvidia GTX 1650 Max-Q. Even more future proof than the Envy --
evidently. Runs Linux quite well; not sure about BSD.

- **Lotus58**: Split-ortho mechanical keyboard, Gazzew Boba LT switches.

- **Logitech Ergo M575**: Wireless ergonomic thumb trackball mouse. 

- **realme Buds Q2**: Truly wireless earphones, with ANC. Picked them up
for 2500 INR (â‰ˆ33 USD).

- **iPhone 13 mini**: The only actually small phone in the market.

- **Kindle KT4**: Jailbroken using [WatchThis](https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=346037)
  and running KOReader.

### old hardware (no longer in active use)

- **HP Envy 13 (2017)**: 13.3" FHD, i5 8250u, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD. A
comfy, fairly future-proof machine that happens to support Linux/BSD
incredibly well out-of-the-box.

- **Ducky One 2 SF**: 65% mechanical keyboard, Cherry MX Speed Silver
switches and blank DSA keycaps. I've written about it in detail
[here](/blog/ducky-one-2).


## software

- **NixOS**: Had to switch to a Linux distribution for work, and this
seemed liked the least-shit choice. I can't claim I understand even half
of Nix (the language), but it gets the job done.

- **cwm**: The Calm Window Manager. The best out-of-the-box experience you can
get in a window manager. Period.

- **tmux**: Most of my actual window management happens here. I usually have
3 - 4 workspaces -- general throwaway terminals, work, music and IRC. It also
handles scrollback for me, so that's nice.

- **weechat**: IRC client that's infinitely riceable.

And the [dotfiles](https://github.com/icyphox/dotfiles) for all software
mentioned, and more. You might be interested in the `old` branch for my
pre-NixOS configs.
