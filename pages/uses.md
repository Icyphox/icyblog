# Uses this.

I often get asked about my computing setup -- so I created this page to link it
whenever. Also because I've seen it on other sites, and I don't want to miss
out.

## hardware

**HP Envy 13 (2017)**: 13.3" FHD, i5 8250u, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD. This is
my primarily computing device. A comfy machine, fairly future-proof
machine that happens to support Linux/BSD incredibly well
out-of-the-box.

**MacBook Pro 13" (2019)**: i5, 8GB RAM, 128GB SSD. My work machine. Not
a huge fan of macOS, but hey -- it could be worse.

**Ducky One 2 SF**: 65% mechanical keyboard, Cherry MX Speed Silver
switches. I've written about it in detail [here](/blog/ducky-one-2).

**Logitech M221**: An el cheapo wireless mouse that mouses just enough.

**Bose Soundsport Wired**: Wired earphones that sound good enough, and fit
well. I also have their wireless model, but don't use them with my laptop.

**OnePlus 6T**: Great phone for the price (SD 845, 8GB/128GB) -- running
OmniROM microG.

**iPad (6th generation)**: A very sophisticated e-reader. I must admit -- Apple
Books offers a very nice reading experience.

## software

**OpenBSD**: Fantastic OS by fantastic devs. What's not to love? Also read
[OpenBSD on the HP Envy 13](/blog/openbsd-hp-envy).

**cwm**: The Calm Window Manager. The best out-of-the-box experience you can
get in a window manager. Period.

**st**: No BS terminal emulator. I use the "ligatures", "copyurl" and "bold is
not bright" patches.

**tmux**: Most of my actual window management happens here. I usually have
3 - 4 workspaces -- general throwaway terminals, work, music and IRC. It also
handles scrollback for me, so that's nice.

**cmus**: With [cmusfm](https://github.com/Arkq/cmusfm) for music.

**weechat**: IRC client that's infinitely riceable.

And the [dotfiles](https://github.com/icyphox/dotfiles) for all software
mentioned, and more.
