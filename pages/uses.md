subtitle: Hardware and software that I use.

I often get asked about my computing setup -- so I created this page to link it
whenever. Also because I've seen it on other sites, and I don't want to miss
out.

## hardware

**HP Envy 13 (2017)**: 13.3" FHD, i5 8250u, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD. This is
my primary computing device. A comfy, fairly future-proof machine that
happens to support Linux/BSD incredibly well out-of-the-box.

**Ducky One 2 SF**: 65% mechanical keyboard, Cherry MX Speed Silver
switches and blank DSA keycaps. I've written about it in detail
[here](/blog/ducky-one-2).

**Logitech M221**: An el cheapo wireless mouse that mouses just enough.

**realme Buds Q2**: Truly wireless earphones, with ANC. Picked them up
for 2500 INR (â‰ˆ33 USD).

**iPhone 13 mini**: The only actually small phone in the market (right
now).

## software

**OpenBSD**: Fantastic OS by fantastic devs. What's not to love? Also read
[OpenBSD on the HP Envy 13](/blog/openbsd-hp-envy).

**cwm**: The Calm Window Manager. The best out-of-the-box experience you can
get in a window manager. Period.

**xterm**: Reliable and rock solid terminal emulator.

**tmux**: Most of my actual window management happens here. I usually have
3 - 4 workspaces -- general throwaway terminals, work, music and IRC. It also
handles scrollback for me, so that's nice.

**weechat**: IRC client that's infinitely riceable.

And the [dotfiles](https://github.com/icyphox/dotfiles) for all software
mentioned, and more.
