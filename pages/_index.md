Hi! I'm Anirudh. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and 
I generally do computer security stuff.  
When I'm not breaking things, I write (pretty) bad code in the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org)
programming language. Or Python, otherwise.  
I enjoy using Linux systems, and I'm the kind of guy who "*rices*"
and has his [dotfiles](https://github.com/icyphox/dotfiles) under version control.  
I do a bunch of other things too, which you can read all about [here](/about).

Want to contact me? The best way is via email, at [icyph0x@pm.me](mailto:icyph0x@pm.me)
or via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/icyphox) DMs.

I now have a [Patreon](https://patreon.com/icyphox)! Of course, there will
be no exclusive "tiers", and all content on my blog will continue to 
be under public domain.
