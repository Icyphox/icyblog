Hi! I'm Anirudh. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science and 
I dabble in computer security.
When I'm not breaking things, I write (terrible) code in the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org)
programming language.
I enjoy using Linux systems, and I'm the kind of guy who "*rices*"
and has his [dotfiles](https://github.com/icyphox/dotfiles) under version control.
I do a bunch of other things too, which you can read all about [here](/about).

Want to contact me? The best way is via email, at [x@icyphox.sh](mailto:x@icyphox.sh)
or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/icyphox) DMs. Or if you prefer IRC, I'm `icy` /
`icyphox` on Rizon and Freenode.
