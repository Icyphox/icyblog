      <h1>PyCon India 2019 wrap-up</h1>
      <h2>Pretty fun weekend, I'd say</h2>
      <p>I&#8217;m writing this article as I sit in class, back on the grind. Last
weekend&#8212;Oct 12th and 13th&#8212;was PyCon India 2019, in Chennai, India.
It was my first PyCon, <em>and</em> my first ever talk at a major conference!
This is an account of the all the cool stuff I saw, people I met and the
talks I enjoyed.
Forgive the lack of pictures &#8211; I prefer living the moment through my 
eyes. </p>

<h3 id="talks">Talks</h3>

<p>So much ML! Not that it&#8217;s a bad thing, but definitely interesting to
note. From what I counted, there were about 17 talks tagged under &#8220;Data
Science, Machine Learning and AI&#8221;. I&#8217;d have liked to see more talks
discussing security and privacy, but hey, the organizers can only pick
from what&#8217;s submitted. ;)</p>

<p>With that point out of the way, here&#8217;s some of the talks I really liked:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Python Packaging - where we are and where we&#8217;re headed</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/pradyunsg">Pradyun</a></li>
<li><strong>Micropython: Building a Physical Inventory Search Engine</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/stonecharioteer">Vinay</a></li>
<li><strong>Ragabot - Music Encoded</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/vikipedia">Vikrant</a></li>
<li><strong>Let&#8217;s Hunt a Memory Leak</strong> by <a href="https://twitter.com/sankeyplus">Sanket</a></li>
<li>oh and of course, <a href="https://twitter.com/dabeaz">David Beazley</a>&#8217;s closing
keynote</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="my-talk">My talk (!!!)</h3>

<p>My good buddy <a href="https://twitter.com/_vologue">Raghav</a> and I spoke about
our smart lock security research. Agreed, it might have been less
&#8220;hardware&#8221; and more of a bug on the server-side, but that&#8217;s the thing
about IoT right? It&#8217;s so multi-faceted, and is an amalgamation of so
many different hardware and software stacks. But, anyway&#8230;</p>

<p>I was reassured by folks after the talk that the silence during Q/A was 
the &#8220;good&#8221; kind of silence. Was it really? I&#8217;ll never know.</p>

<h3 id="some-nice-people-i-met">Some nice people I met</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/abhirathb">Abhirath</a> &#8211; A 200 IQ lad. Talked to
me about everything from computational biology to the physical
implementation of quantum computers.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/meain_">Abin</a> &#8211; He recognized me from my
<a href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn">r/unixporn</a> posts, which was pretty
awesome.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/h6165">Abhishek</a></li>
<li>Pradyun and Vikrant (linked earlier)</li>
</ul>

<p>And a lot of other people doing really great stuff, whose names I&#8217;m
forgetting.</p>

<h3 id="pictures">Pictures!</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s not much, and
I can&#8217;t be bothered to format them like a collage or whatever, so I&#8217;ll
just dump them here &#8211; as is.</p>

<h3 id="cest-tout">C&#8217;est tout</h3>

<p>Overall, a great time and a weekend well spent. It was very different
from your typical security conference &#8211; a lot more <em>chill</em>, if you
will. The organizers did a fantastic job and the entire event was put
together really well.
I don&#8217;t have much else to say, but I know for sure that I&#8217;ll be
there next time.</p>

<p>That was PyCon India, 2019.</p>
